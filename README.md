## General Information
- The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn
- It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
- It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
